<li>Once it begins boiling, cover the sufuria with foil tightly and reduce the heat to the lowest heat</li>
<li>The rice will simmer on low heat for about 15-20 minutes until it dries out</li>
<li>Once the rice is dry, remove the foil and fluff the rice using a fork. Remove and discard the bay leaves</li>
<li>Use the fork to mix up the rice with any of the beef and onions that might have floated and settled at the top</li>
<li>Serve hot with some fresh kachumbari</li>
